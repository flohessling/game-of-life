# Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life running in the terminal.

It is written in Go and using bubbletea for the terminal rendering.

## TODOs

- [x] Add a frame around the grid.
- [x] Add helper menu to display `q` and `ctrl-c` to quit.
    - Fix help menu not showing when updating the model
- [ ] Add a pause button and a speed control.
- [ ] Add a way to change the grid size.
- [ ] Make the starting pattern configurable (currently it's hardcoded in the initial model).
    - Maybe using a first menu to choose from different patterns?
