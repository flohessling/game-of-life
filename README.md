# Game of Life

This is a simple implementation of Conway's Game of Life running in the terminal.

It is written in Go and using bubbletea for the terminal rendering.

## TODOs

- Add a frame around the grid (using viewport maybe?).
- Add helper menu to display `q` and `ctrl-c` to quit.
- Add a pause button and a speed control.
- Add a way to change the grid size.
- Make the starting pattern configurable (currently it's hardcoded in the initial model).
